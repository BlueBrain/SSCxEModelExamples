TITLE Probabilistic AMPA and NMDA receptor with presynaptic short-term plasticity


COMMENT
AMPA and NMDA receptor conductance using a dual-exponential profile
presynaptic short-term plasticity as in Fuhrmann et al. 2002

_EMS (Eilif Michael Srikanth)
Modification of ProbAMPANMDA: 2-State model by Eilif Muller, Michael Reimann, Srikanth Ramaswamy, Blue Brain Project, August 2011
This new model was motivated by the following constraints:

1) No consumption on failure.
2) No release just after release until recovery.
3) Same ensemble averaged trace as deterministic/canonical Tsodyks-Markram
   using same parameters determined from experiment.
4) Same quantal size as present production probabilistic model.

To satisfy these constaints, the synapse is implemented as a
uni-vesicular (generalization to multi-vesicular should be
straight-forward) 2-state Markov process.  The states are
{1=recovered, 0=unrecovered}.

For a pre-synaptic spike or external spontaneous release trigger
event, the synapse will only release if it is in the recovered state,
and with probability u (which follows facilitation dynamics).  If it
releases, it will transition to the unrecovered state.  Recovery is as
a Poisson process with rate 1/Dep.

This model satisys all of (1)-(4).
